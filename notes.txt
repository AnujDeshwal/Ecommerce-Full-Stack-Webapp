topic: How to connect to the mongodb 
    simple run your compass and connect it with the localhost and then go to the vs code and run the code to connect the backend from mongodb in mongoose , where as soon as you will run post request in your database databse would be created with the provided name you have given in the url simple .
Model: model is a collection simple or a table you can say of a particular thing here it is of product .
Controller: controller is basically which control the model means will do all crud operation in the model   
Product.save is different from insert because if you will provide id to it so it will behave as update but if no id so it will work as normal insertion
topic: important about the exports. 
here like you are in the folder you have exports many thing like exports like exports.add=add 
, exports.sub = sub then at the file where you are using in that file you are importing them like 
const {add, sub} =  require('./routes/products) ; here by destructuring you have just separate add and sub while importing now you can directly use them . but if you will import like 
const temp = require('/routes/products') here it always come in a object so you can use them like 
temp.add and temp.sub 
topic:very important thing about the mongoose is that there is a thing in the like whatever you did write query like you applied find ,skip whatevery query you need some apply but it will be executed if you will apply .exec() after those query which will execute them in reality and amother important thing about :::CLONE: that if you execute a query you can not execute it again it will throw an error and if you want to run the same query again just clone it like in that same query whih was executed write this query.clone().exec() then it will execute again 
topic: one important thing about mongoose is that in it all queries are promises so if you want it to executed then other things should work so use await and in the await also use try catch to catch the error 
topic:whenever you are applying try can catch and then sending the error as response so that error does not go in response many times so just console.log it .
Topic : how api is working or connecting between frontend and backend 
so basically we are using api in the frontend by using fetch api so whatever they are doing is calling the api , and api has been made in the backend  and whatever request they are sending from the frontend while calling the api we are getting these request in the backend in our api , when they are sending something with the api call it is call post request , so if they are calling a api with post request so we must have that api with the post property in our backend so basically whatever data they send in the body of the request while calling the api so this can be fetched by the req.body in the backend ,and to make a api we need three things first is controller in whicch all query for database is mentioned , then model comes which is the schema of the api call basically for that api may be data would come from a tabel of collection of the database so first you have to make a collection or model in the database so to make this you have model file so run all query inside it you have controller and now you made the api but now connect it to the route folder in which url it will be shown then route folder comes in play and then if already mentioned on the url so go to the index.js and routes are made already over there where something already added in the base address . 
Topic:to check what is error 
go to inspect then go to network error it will show all api calls if you click on fetch/XHR then just check their status either 200 or 404 
Topic:another error is unexpected end of json so this means that he is trying to fetch json data but json data aa nahi paa raha from the backend so just go to network and see if any request is giving you 404 not found error
